# SpriteTools - Unreal Engine 5.4

Simple Plugin for Unreal 5.4 created to correct the Pivot Offset problem in Unreal Paper 2D sprites.

## Setup & Usage

Add to the Plugins folder of your Unreal project.
I haven't tested on previous versions of Unreal, but it might just work!

### Select the Paper2D Sprites:

### Run the Scripted editor function to adjust the pivot:

### The Problem
It is obvious when we have to flip sprites. Rotation / Scale are relative to the Pivot:

### Result
The pivot is now set at the Origin:
